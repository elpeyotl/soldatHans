Soldat Hans are a band from Winterthur, Switzerland. They play rather dark and heavy music, which scratches the realms of downtempo, slowcore, doom, post-rock, jazz, folk and psychedelic art-rock – by incorporating various instruments like guitars, bass, drums, organs & synthesizers, brass and strings.<br ><br>

The formation began as an instrumental noise collective playing solely improvised sets. Around 2013 they settled to write some material for their first album “Dress Rehearsal” which was released in November 2014. Taking their name from the old fairytale “Des Teufels russiger Bruder” by the brothers Grimm, the sound of Soldat Hans somehow still echoes the desolate feeling of this very tale. Their debut‘s approach was further underlined by their second release in 2018 called „Es Taut“. The third album aptly titeld „Anthaupt“ was finished in 2021 and will be released on vinyl as soon as the manufactories are again up and running. Soldat Hans is with the german label „Wolves and Vibrancy Records“.<br ><br>
